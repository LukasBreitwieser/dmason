#Socially Damaging Behaviours

This is an Agent-Based model inspired by the paper "Neminem laedere. An evolutionary agent-based model of the interplay between punishment and damaging behaviours" from Nicola Lettieri and Domenico Parisi. 
This project includes two versions the first developed with MASON toolkit and the second one in DMASON a distributed version of MASON.

The explanatory and predictive power of social simulations is more and more connected with the development of models accounting for the complexity of real (inter-individual and intra-individual) social dynamics. From this perspective, a promising research path is complementing very simple models, more suitable to illuminate core dynamics of social phenomena, with increasingly more complex and empirically grounded simulations (big data-driven models, higher number of agents, more detailed and realistic description of cognitive and communication mechanisms underlying individual and group behaviors). The choice has two strictly intertwined effects: not only a different modeling approach, but also the need for more powerful tools.The paper presents a distributed implementation of an agent-based model exploring the interplay between damaging behaviors, sanctions and social mechanisms of learning and imitation, a topic investigated in many areas of social science from economics to legal science. Taking cue from a previous work based on a simple NetLogo simulation, the work shows how distributed solutions canhelp in developing more complex, wide and semantically rich models
