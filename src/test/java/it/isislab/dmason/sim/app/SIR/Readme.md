#SIR (Susceptible Infected Recovered)
This model demonstrates the spread of a virus. Although the model is somewhat abstract. Each agent may be in one of three states: susceptible, infected, or resistant. In the academic literature such a model is sometimes referred to as an SIR model for epidemics. 

Each time step , each infected agent (colored red) attempts to infect all of its neighbors. Susceptible neighbors (colored green) will be infected with a probability given by the VIRUS-SPREAD-CHANCE. Resistant agents (colored blue) cannot be infected.  Infected agents are not immediately aware that they are infected. Only every so often (determined by the VIRUS-CHECK-FREQUENCY) do the agents check whether they are infected by a virus. When the virus has been detected, there is a probability that the virus will be removed determined by the RECOVERY-CHANCE. If an agent does recover, there is some probability that it will become resistant to this virus in the future (given by the GAIN-RESISTANCE-CHANCE).
