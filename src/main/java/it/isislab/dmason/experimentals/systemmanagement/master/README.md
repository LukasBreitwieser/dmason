## Execute Master for DMason System Management

To execute Master you need to run MasterServerMain.java. This class starts the Apache ActiveMQ server, so if you want to change default parameters configuration such as port 61616 you must set the configuration in /resources/systemmanagement/master/conf/config.properties file.
