# dmason2.5
DMASON 2.5 is a parallel version of the MASON library for writing and running simulations of Agent based simulation models.

D-MASON is a distributed version of MASON. MASON is a quite widespread frame-work for ABMs (Agent-Based Models). The rationale of developing D-MASON is to provide a solution that does not require the user to rewrite his simulations and, nonetheless, pushing the limits of the maximum number of agents.
