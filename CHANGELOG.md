# Changelog DMASON 3.2

### 1. Add Performance tracing option for simulations
A new option in Settings is available to enable performance tracing for running simulations: when enabled, it is shown into workers consoles as a 3-tuple (type,step,computation\_time,communication\_time).

## TODO LIST
- Workers reconnection (beta version has been created) 
- Simulation Viewer for uniform field partitioning (beta version has been created) 
- Include communication with MPI in System Management 
- Ultimate JUnit Testing
- Distributed 3D Fields  

For further details, read the [README.md](https://github.com/isislab-unisa/dmason/blob/master/src/main/java/it/isislab/dmason/sim/field/network/kway/README.md) file.
